The reason all VMs in the availability set must be stopped before performing the resize operation to a size that requires different hardware is that all running VMs in the availability set must be using the same physical hardware cluster. Therefore, if a change of physical hardware cluster is required to change the VM size then all VMs must be first stopped and then restarted one-by-one to a different physical hardware clusters.

Storing the password in a Key Vault ensures that it is not stored in plain text and provides an additional layer of security to protect the password.
2. An access policy: You should create an access policy to control access to the Key Vault secrets. An access policy specifies who can perform operations on the secrets stored in the Key Vault. You can grant permissions to users, applications, and services to access the Key Vault and its secrets, and you can specify the level of access that they have. By creating an access policy, you can control who has access to the administrative password and ensure that it is used only by authorized entities.

When a VM is infected with ransomware, you should not restore the VM to the infected VM. This is because the ransomware will still be present on the VM, and it will encrypt the files again. You should also not restore the VM to any VM within the company&apos;s subscription. This is because the ransomware could spread to other VMs in the subscription. The best way to restore a VM that is infected with ransomware is to restore it to a new Azure VM. This will ensure that the ransomware is not present on the new VM.</feedback><correct>1</correct><percent-correct>89</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer><answer><text>You should restore the VM to an on-premise Windows device.</text><feedback></feedback><correct>0</correct><percent-correct>0</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer></answers></question-record><question-record><question>You administer a solution in Azure that is currently having performance issues.

To RG6, you apply the tag: RGroup: RG6.
You deploy a virtual network named VNET2 to RG6.
Which tags apply to VNET1 and VNET2? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

The TXT/MX record added is needed only for the verification step (to assure that you are the owner of the domain), after that it can be removed. 

The similar document for Microsoft 365 clarifies this:

Otherwise, it can interfere with sending and receiving email. You should delete this records as soon as domain verification is complete.&amp;#x201D; 

I suppose that the usage of MX record was introduced due to some restriction on the handling of TXT records by some DNS registrars, but I do not have found direct evidence for this.</feedback><correct>1</correct><percent-correct>100</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer><answer><text>NSEC</text><feedback></feedback><correct>0</correct><percent-correct>0</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer><answer><text>PTR</text><feedback></feedback><correct>0</correct><percent-correct>0</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer><answer><text>RRSIG</text><feedback></feedback><correct>0</correct><percent-correct>0</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer></answers></question-record><question-record><question>Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.

Deleting a resource group deletes all of its template deployments and currently stored operations. 

As an administrator, you can lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock overrides any permissions the user might have. You can&apos;t delete a vault that contains backup data. Once backup data is deleted, it will go into the soft deleted state. 

So you have to remove the lock on order to delete the VNET and delete the backups in order to delete the vault.

To do this, you need to modify the NS (Name Server) records at the DNS domain registrar for contoso.com to point to the Azure DNS name servers. This will allow the authoritative DNS server for contoso.com to be hosted in Azure and answer queries for the contoso.com zone. 

Option A is not the correct answer, because creating NS records in the contoso.com zone will not delegate the domain to the Azure DNS name servers. 
Option B is also not the correct answer, because modifying the SOA (Start of Authority) record in the DNS domain registrar will not delegate the domain to the Azure DNS name servers either. 
Option C is also not necessary, because Azure DNS automatically creates an SOA record for each zone, and it cannot be modified.</feedback><correct>1</correct><percent-correct>100</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer></answers></question-record><question-record><question>HOTSPOT -

You need to ensure that an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user named Admin1 is assigned the required role to enable Traffic Analytics for an Azure subscription.

Solution: You assign the Traffic Manager Contributor role at the subscription level to Admin1.

Does this meet the goal?</question><clue></clue><category></category><weighting>100</weighting><fixed>0</fixed><question-type>1</question-type><answers><answer><text>Yes</text><feedback></feedback><correct>0</correct><percent-correct>0</percent-correct><include-in-mc-options>1</include-in-mc-options></answer><answer><text>No</text><feedback>No, assigning the Traffic Manager Contributor role to Admin1 at the subscription level will not meet the goal of enabling Traffic Analytics for the Azure subscription. 

The Traffic Manager Contributor role only grants permissions to manage Traffic Manager profiles, endpoints, and traffic routing methods, but it does not provide the necessary permissions to enable Traffic Analytics for the Azure subscription. To enable Traffic Analytics for an Azure subscription, you need to assign the Log Analytics Contributor role to the Azure AD user named Admin1. 

The Log Analytics Contributor role allows the user to manage Log Analytics workspaces, which is required to enable Traffic Analytics for the Azure subscription. Therefore, assigning the Traffic Manager Contributor role to Admin1 will not meet the goal of enabling Traffic Analytics for the Azure subscription.
