Your network contains an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named contoso.com. The domain contains the servers shown in the following table.
&amp;#x003C;img src=&quot;q107-t5-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;q107-t5-1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;q107-t5-1&quot; width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;110&quot;/&amp;#x003E;
You plan to migrate contoso.com to Azure.

You create an Azure virtual network named VNET1 that has the following settings:

&amp;#x2022; Address space: 10.0.0.0/16
&amp;#x2022; Subnet:
o Name: Subnet1
o IPv4: 10.0.1.0/24

You need to move DC1 to VNET1. The solution must ensure that the member servers in contoso.com can resolve AD DS DNS names.

How should you configure DC1? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
